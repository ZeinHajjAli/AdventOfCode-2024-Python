# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. These daily puzzles cover a range of topics, from algorithms and data structures to creative problem-solving. Perfect for keeping coding skills sharp during the holiday season.

I'm not trying to solve them in time for the global leaderboard, but instead I just want to test my hand at the problems since they're more fun than just grinding LeetCode.

Some of the solutions might be severely unoptimized, but I'm using it as a way to work through my first thought on the problems rather than something scalable or very extensible.

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event featuring 25 programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th.

## Structure
Each day's solution is in its own directory:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ day01/
â”œâ”€â”€ day02/
â”œâ”€â”€ day03/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

and usually in a Jupyter notebook (`solution.ipynb`). I've also included my input.txt files (and sometimes the example input) to be able to reproduce my answers.
